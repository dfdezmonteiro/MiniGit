# MiniGit fork

This is a fork of [`light-tech/MiniGit`](https://github.com/light-tech/MiniGit).

## Fork changes

This fork adds small API extensions:

1. Exposes the underlying `libgit2` `git_diff_delta.status` value through `DiffDelta.status`.
2. Adds support for discarding working tree changes for a specific tracked file.

These changes keep the original MiniGit behavior and only expose missing functionality required by Swift/iOS clients.

---

## 1. Exposed diff delta status

This fork exposes the raw `libgit2` delta status value through:

```objc
@property (readonly) int status;
```

Added to:

```text
Sources/XGit/include/DiffDelta.h
```

Assigned from:

```objc
self->_status = delta->status;
```

in:

```text
Sources/XGit/internal/DiffDelta.mm
```

This allows Swift/iOS clients to distinguish Git file changes more accurately, including:

- modified
- added
- deleted
- renamed
- copied
- untracked
- ignored
- type changed
- unreadable
- conflicted

### Purpose

The original MiniGit `DiffDelta` exposes file paths but not the raw delta status. This makes untracked files difficult to distinguish from modified files.

---

## 2. Discard working tree changes

This fork adds support for discarding local working tree changes for a specific tracked file.

### Added API

```objc
- (void)discard:(nonnull NSString*)path :(id _Nullable)errorReceiver;
```

Added to:

```text
Sources/XGit/include/Repository.h
```

Implemented in:

```text
Sources/XGit/Repository.mm
Sources/XGit/internal/CheckoutHandler.mm
```

### Behavior

Discarding a single file is equivalent to:

```bash
git restore path
```

Example:

```objc
[repository discard:@"Notes/today.md" :errorReceiver];
```

This restores the file from `HEAD` and discards unstaged working tree changes for that path.

### Difference between `discard` and `unstage`

This is different from:

```bash
git restore --staged path
```

which only unstages a file.

MiniGit already supports unstaging through:

```objc
- (void)unstage:(nonnull NSString*)path :(id _Nullable)errorReceiver;
```

The new `discard` API is for discarding file content changes in the working tree.

### Tracked files only

`discard(path)` restores tracked files from `HEAD`.

It does not remove untracked files. Removing untracked files would require separate `git clean` functionality, which is not included in this fork.

# MiniGit

Minimal Swift package to provide most common Git functionalities.

Check out [OmiGit](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/omigit/id1597699768) on the App Store for illustration of the package's features. See also [our sample app](https://github.com/light-tech/MiniGit-SampleApp).

While `SwiftGit2` already provides a Swift binding for `libgit2`, it is lacking some crucial features such as `git push`.

In an attempt to implement those, we come to believe it is best to write C code in C/C++ instead of [Swift's syntax for C code](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/main/docs/HowSwiftImportsCAPIs.md) so that it will be much easier for future development and maintenance.

Thankfully, Apple's Swift Package Manager now supported Swift modules written in Objective-C.

This leads us to make a new Swift package `MiniGit` to provide the bare minimal Git functionality written in Objective-C that could be used in Swift-based projects.

But really it is just C++ mostly: Objective-C was to establish an interface to the Swift side.

There are two libraries, modules to be precise, in this Swift package:

- **XGit**: The eXtensible Git module, written in Objective-C, whose classes could be subclassed to provide extra functionalities desired. All interactions with `libgit2` happen here.
- **MiniGit**: The UI extension of XGit whose classes extend those of XGit and conform to `Identifiable` and `ObservableObject` to support SwiftUI binding.

# Features

Provide key features from the following commonly used `git` commands:

- `git init`
- `git clone`
- `git status`
- `git diff`
- `git add`
- `git restore --staged`
- `git restore <path>`
- `git commit`
- `git log`
- `git branch`
- `git push`
- `git fetch`
- `git merge`
- `git checkout`
- `git reset`

There is one notable behavioral difference in the `merge` implementation: **We do not create the merge commit automatically.**

After a merge, the client must do that to clear the MERGE state after resolving all conflicts, or reset to discard the unwanted merge.

This allows user to fill in the commit message and update user name/email in the UI if necessary since we do not support amend last commit at this point.

# Usage

If you use both XGit and MiniGit, i.e. add both to your project's target **Frameworks, Libraries and Embedded Contents**, then you are good to go.

If you use the core module XGit by itself only, then you must add the `libgit2.xcframework`, `libz.tbd` and `libiconv.tbd` to your project's target **Frameworks, Libraries and Embedded Contents**.

When building for real iPhone, disable Bitcode.

See [our sample app](https://github.com/light-tech/MiniGit-SampleApp) for a starting point.

# Design

XGit was designed with SwiftUI interoperability in mind.

The module single entry point is the `Repository` class.

Its methods pretty much follows the corresponding `git` command, except for `git init` since `init` has dedicated meaning in Objective-C.

There is only one constructor with a supplied repository path which does not open the repository automatically.

The constructor does not fail so one checks `exists` method after `open` to see if there is really a repository there.

To allow data classes to be extensible and interoperate with SwiftUI, we make use of the factory methods: Subclass of `Repository` can override `makeCommit` to return the desired instance of a `Commit` subclass.

The majority of other classes are designed as wrapper for their `libgit2` C counterparts: We essentially keep a private pointer to the C struct and free it automatically on `deinit`.

For example, we have class `Commit` as wrapper for libgit2's `git_commit` to expose the latter's key information, such as author, time and OID, as Objective-C's properties.

Notable exceptions are the `Diff`-related, `OID` and `GitError` classes which are meant to be used as data-converted value `struct`s, immutable state, rather than actual classes.

We also use `@protocol` such as `StatusProtocol`, `CheckoutProtocol`, `MergeProtocol` to capture complicated returned results such as `git status`, to report the progress of operations and to report errors.

For example: In `git status` implementation, instead of returning a `Status` object in Objective-C, we take a `StatusProtocol` as input through which we report the staged changes, unstaged changes, etc.

This is to make it easier to use in SwiftUI: Swift client could then implement the `Status` class conforming to `StatusProtocol` and `ObservableObject` so that the status could be bound to a SwiftUI `View`.

# Implementation

Most functionalities are implemented by literally **copy and paste** libgit2's sample codes.

However, to avoid usage of `goto` statements to perform clean-up and deallocate objects upon failure, we use single-use C++ struct and make use of the fact that as an object goes out of scope, it gets destroyed automatically.

# Source structure

- `include/`: Module export, umbrella header `Repository.h` and the supplementary headers.
- `internal/`: Internal implementation, excluded from the package, as they are `#import`ed directly into the single main implementation file `Repository.mm`.
- `Repository.mm`: Our main implementation file.
